    "1. Yes, it will work without the `::Number` specifications, as Julia will try to apply the function to whatever is in the input. Julia only uses it as a hint and to choose which method of a function to use (if you have many definition of a function with different input types).\n",
    "2. No, `4ac` would not work, as Julia reads this as 4 times the variable `ac`. It can only infer multiplication between numbers and letters, not between letters (how else could you have a varible called `ac`).\n",
    "3. This is a syntax error. `Δ = 0` uses the equal sign to mean \"set the left-hand-side variable to the value of the right-hand-side\". In other programming languages, this also produces a value, but it does not in Julia, so it cannot use it as the condition for the `if`-statement.\n",
    "4. Yes, using `.+` adds `-b` to both elements of the array (this is similar to how MATLAB would turn `-b` into an array and add elememt-wise). However, if `+` is used instead, we are using array addition, but the dimensions of `-b` dont match `[√Δ,-√Δ]`. Thus, Julia thows an error, as it has no other method for `+` that adds scalars to arrats. (The term \"broadcast\" is used in the first case where `-b` is added to the whole of the array.)\n",
    "5. Yes, without `return roots` the function will still return. This is because `roots` is always the last variable assigned, so will be the result of the function (the last modified variable within a function will be returned if no explicit value is given).\n",
    "6. There are many inputs that lead to either errors or do not \"work\" (depending on your interpretation of \"work\"). We have classified them into three different types:\n",
    "    1. Consider if `a` is `0`, `0.0` or `-0.0` or any of the arguments are `NaN`, `Inf` or `-Inf`. We also include arguments that convert to `Inf` or `-Inf` when converted to type `::Float64` in this category (e.g. `BigInt(10^1000)`). This set of input lead to \"valid\" output (in the sense that there are no errors thrown and that the output is of type `::Number`). If `a` is set to `0`, `0.0` or `-0.0`, then we divide by 0 in the line `roots = (-b .+ [√Δ,-√Δ])/(2a)`. This leads to values such as `NaN` (not a number), `Inf` or `-Inf`, which may be considered as the function not \"working\". Likewise, if any of the arguments are `NaN`, `Inf` or `-Inf`, these will propogate throughout, leadng to these values in the output. Whether you call this \"working\" or not is personal preference, but we have included them here for completeness.\n",
    "    2. Consider if any of the arguments are of type `::Number`, but are not of type `::Real`. An example of such a value  is an complex values such as `im`. These cases will throw errors at some point, either because they cannot be converted into type `::Float64` or earlier if some other operation cannot accept those types (e.g. `<` in `if Δ < 0` will throw an error if `Δ` is complex).\n",
    "7. This can be seen above. It does work, if we only want to remove when `a` is zero. If we want to solve all issues dicussed above, further steps are needed. If you consider any input of `NaN`, `Inf` or `-Inf` to be faulty, you need to replace `if a == 0` with `if a==0 || !all(isfinite.([a,b,c]))`. The code `all(isfinite.([a,b,c]))` makes sure that the arguments are reasonable. To fix issue B, you can replace the first line `function real_roots_of_quadratic(a::Number, b::Number, c::Number)` with `function real_roots_of_quadratic(a::Real, b::Real, c::FReal)`, ensuring that all arguments can be used appropriately.\n",
    "8. This also works. In a lot of languages (Perl and C being the exaples thought of by us), the left-hand-side of logical conjugation is evaluated first, as if it is false, then there is no point in evaluating the right-hand-side (mathematically $\\bot\\land P\\equiv\\bot$ for any $P$). In the code above, if `a == 0` is false, the line is skipped. However, if it is true, we must also check the right-hand-side, so `return \"Error - this is not a quadratic equation\"` is evaluated and hence the function returns with the error.\n",
    "9. The use of `&&` is just like above. The code `throw(DomainError(a, \"argument must be nonzero\"))` (from inspection and intuition from other languages) \"throws\" an error. Specifically a new \"object\" (we are assuming errors are objects) called a `DomainError` is created. The first argument gives the reason for the domain error, and `\"argument must be nonzero\"` provides a human readible string. This is then \"thrown\"; in more general terms, the error is brought up to Julia's attention and Julia halts progress, notifying the user of the error. We also assume that this means when you call `real_roots_of_quadratic`, you could also try to catch an error, and deal with it appropriately."

    "The biggest slow point of the original function is due to time complexity. `hail_max(N)` runs for each value in `step_range`. For each of these runs we calculate `hail_length(x)` for each value less than or equal to `N`. This two sets of loops means that the run time is $O(n^2)$. This is quite slow, where if we calculate all the `hail_length`s fisrt, then find the cumulative maximum, we reduce the time complexity to $O(n)$. This stops us calling `hail_length` on small numbers repeatedly.\n",

    "We will first focus on `random_binary_string`. `rand(['0','1'])` selects a `0` or a `1` with uniform probability (pseudo-probability, based on the seed). This is repeated `n` times by `[rand(['0','1']) for _ in 1:n]`, which calls `rand` for each element in `1:n` and puts it into an array. The variable `_` is used a s a placeholder, as the actual index of the array does not affect what output will be there. The threee dots after this expands out the array as the inputs of the next function. This function `*`, when dealing with characters is concatination (as a string), so all the selected characters get pushed together into a string, producing the final binary string. All this code is the definition of the function `random_binary_string` whose only argument `n` (the length of the returned string) has default 12.\n",

In this case, `n` has default 3, so without any arguments a \"hex string\" of length 3 will be returned (as seen)."
